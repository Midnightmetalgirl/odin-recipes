            <p>This is the best homemade recipe for ice cream I have ever come across!
                It has simple ingredients and is <en>SUPER</en> customizable! The reason
                why it says that it is in a jar is because you can shake it up and freeze
                it all in a mason jar. That means <strong>less dishes and cleanup!!!</strong>
                Check out the ingredients below and mix away!
